# Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

## Heroes of Pymoli

Creating a script utilizing Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and reorganize a list of purchasing record for an imaginary F2P online game. In the purchase data csv file, we are given datas includ: "Purchase ID", "SN", "Age", "Gender", "Item ID", "Item Name", "Price". We will need to use these to analyze purchasing behaviors of different demographics such as different age group or gender, as well as sales performance of in-game virtual items. 

In this exercise, I will be presenting the summary tables using either a Python dictionary or Pandas Data Frames within a Jupyter Notebook file. Also, at the last cell of Jupyter Notebook, I have my written descriptions of my observations of the data.
